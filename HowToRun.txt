====================================== Debugging ======================================
1. The output of your CGI program
    Great! That means everything worked fine. If the output is correct, but the browser is not processing it correctly, make sure you have the correct Content-Type set in your CGI program.


2. The source code of your CGI program or a "POST Method Not Allowed" message
    That means that you have not properly configured Apache to process your CGI program. Reread the section on configuring Apache and try to find what you missed.

3. A message starting with "Forbidden"
    That means that there is a permissions problem. Check the Apache error log and the section below on file permissions.

4. A message saying "Internal Server Error"
    If you check the Apache error log, you will probably find that it says "Premature end of script headers", possibly along with an error message generated by your CGI program. In this case, you will want to check each of the below sections to see what might be preventing your CGI program from emitting the proper HTTP headers.

logs are stored in /var/log/apache2/error.log
